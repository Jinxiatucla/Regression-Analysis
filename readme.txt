To run the code, we need to have two directories, codes and data, in the same level. We put out codes into the codes directory and put the dataset, namely network_backup_dataset.csv into the data directory.

Part 1  => Load the dataset and plot
Part 2a => Linear regression model
Part 2b => Random forest algorithm
Part 2c => Neural network
Part 2d => Polynomial model
Part 2e => K-nearest neighbor regression
